# Card Game: Super 8

## Object of the Game
The goal is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards in his hand.

## Card Values/Scoring
The player who is the first to have no cards left wins the game. The winning player collects from each other player the value of the cards remaining in that player’s hand as follows:
`Each eight = 50 points`
`Each K, Q, J or 10 = 10 points`
`Each ace = 1 point`
`Each other card is the pip value`

## The Play
Starting to the dealer’s left, each player must place one card face up on the starter pile. Each card played (other than an eight) must match the card showing on the starter pile, either in suit or in denomination.

Example: If the Q of Clubs is the starter, any club may be played on it or any Queen.

If unable to play, cards are drawn from the top of the stock until a play is possible, or until the stock is exhausted. If unable to play when the stock is exhausted, the player must pass. A player may draw from the stock, even though there may be a playable card in the player’s hand.

## All eights are wild!
That is, an eight may be played at any time in turn, and the player need only specify a suit for it (but never a number). The next player must play either a card of the specified suit or an eight.
